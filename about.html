        <p>What if a force often seen as colonizing the art world could be used as a tool of decolonization instead? In this creative coding project, artist Sarah Macaraeg explores indigenous aspects of her Filipina heritage:</p>
        <p><b>Batok:</b> Centenarian Apo Whang-Od has nearly single-handedly kept ancient Filipino tattoo arts, known as batok, alive. In batok, specific symbols and their placement have meaning. In the pre-colonial era, tattoos on hands and wrists denoted a first victory. Chest tattoos were given to those who have been in a series of battles and facial tattoos were reserved for only the bravest warriors of the tribe.<br><i>Photo of Whang-Od hung inside her home, via <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=78669494"target="_blank">Creative Commons.</a></i></p>
        <p><b>Okir:</b> A flowing and nature-based, pre-colonial style of art found in vernacular art and architecture, inspired by ocean and wind currents and ferns and serpents. <br><i>Photo of okir carving via <a href="https://openverse.org/image/567e15c5-e67e-415f-8c6c-87290dfd80c8?q=torogan&p=3"target="_blank">Creative Commons.</a></i></p>
        <p><b>Textile:</b> Seemingly simple indigenous textile patterns are often based on complex geometry. As the School of Traditional Arts in London notes in its <a href="https://schooloftraditionalarts.org/our-impact/projects/the-philippines/"target="_blank">research</a> on the Philippines, "Too often, textiles produced outside the First World are considered as ethnographic material rather than examples of traditional fine art." <br><i>Photo courtesy the artist.</i></p>
